    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>1 tablespoon of oil</li>
      <li>1/4 pound Yukon gold potatoes, cut into 1/4" to 1/2" cubes</li>
      <li>1/2 green bell pepper, diced</li>
      <li>1/4 teaspoon sea salt</li>
      <li>6 links of sausage</li>
      <li>3 eggs</li>
      <li>1/2 cup shredded cheddar cheese</li>
      <li>Chopped green onions, ground black pepper, hot sauce to serve</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Heat a large skillet over medium heat and add 1/2 tablespoon of oil. Add
        the potatoes and cook, turning them occasionally, until they begin to
        brown, about 10-15 minutes.
      </li>
      <li>
        Add another 1/2 tablespoon of oil and the green bell pepper. Saute for 5
        minutes until beginning to soften, then add the onion and salt. Saute
        for about 5 minutes, until the onion is soft and beginning to take on
        color. Add the sausage and cook until browned.
      </li>
      <li>
        Thoroughly beat the eggs in a bowl. Once all the vegetables are soft and
        browned, lower the heat and push them to the sides of the pan. Add a bit
        of oil to the center of the pan, then add the eggs and the shredded
        cheese to the skillet. Use your spatula to scramble the eggs until they
        set. Then, fold the vegetables back into the mix.
      </li>
      <li>
        Remove from the heat and top with sliced green onions, cracked pepper,
        and hot sauce (optional).
      </li>
    </ol>
