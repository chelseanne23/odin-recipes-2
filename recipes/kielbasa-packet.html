    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Heavy duty aluminum foil</li>
      <li>Parchment paper</li>
      <li>7 oz kielbasa</li>
      <li>12 oz small potatoes</li>
      <li>1/2 onion</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon sea salt</li>
      <li>1/2 teaspoon garlic powder</li>
      <li>1/4 teaspoon paprika</li>
      <li>2 tablespoons spicy mustard</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon honey</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon apple cide vinegar</li>
      <li>2 tablespoons butter</li>
      <li>parsley</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Slice the kielbasa into 1/2 inch rounds, cut potatoes into 1-inch
        pieces, and roughly chop the onion.
      </li>
      <li>
        Tear 4 x 18” pieces of heavy-duty foil for each packet, along with 4 x
        16” sheets of parchment paper for each. Layer the parchment paper on top
        of the foil.
      </li>
      <li>
        Divide the kielbasa, potatoes, onions, salt & spices, sauce, and butter
        between the four sheets of foil.
      </li>
      <li>
        To form the packets, bring one of the short edges of the foil to meet
        the other, then crimp around all edges to seal.
      </li>
      <li>
        Cook the packets on a grill (or the grill grate over your campfire) for
        18-22 minutes, flipping after 10 minutes, until the potatoes are tender.
      </li>
      <li>
        Remove from the grill and let cool slightly. Open the packets
        carefully—they will be full of hot steam. Top with fresh parsley and
        enjoy!
      </li>
    </ol>
