    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Filling</li>
      <ul>
        <li>3-4 ripe peaches</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon sugar</li>
      </ul>
      <li>Topping</li>
      <ul>
        <li>1/4 cup butter, melted</li>
        <li>1/2 cup flour</li>
        <li>1/4 cup sugar</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon baking powder</li>
        <li>1/4 teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>whipped cream, optional</li>
      </ul>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Start your campfire so you'll have embers to work with, or light your
        charcoal briquettes. Line the Dutch oven with a round of parchment
        paper.
      </li>
      <li>
        Place the butter in an enamel or metal bowl and set it near the campfire
        to melt.
      </li>
      <li>
        Cut the peaches into bite-sized pieces. Place them in the lined Dutch
        oven and sprinkle with 2 tablespoons of sugar.
      </li>
      <li>
        Mix the flour, remaining sugar, baking powder, and salt in a bowl.
      </li>
      <li>
        Once the butter is melted, pour it in to the dry ingredients. Using a
        fork, mix thoroughly until you reach a soft, crumbly consistency.
      </li>
      <li>
        Spread the crumbly topping over the peaches in the Dutch oven. Cover
        with the lid.
      </li>
      <li>
        Transfer the Dutch oven to the fire ring. Place 7 coals under the oven
        in a circle, and place 14 coals on the lid to create ~350F heat. Bake
        20-30 minutes, until the filling is bubbling and the topping is golden.
        You may need to add coals if they begin to cool down.
      </li>
      <li>Remove from the campfire and serve with whipped cream!</li>
    </ol>
